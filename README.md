BMES Project Team's Dataframe workshop: Pokemons and Where to Find Them
Hi you! Welcome to Project Team's Python dataframe workshop themed in Pokemons! We recently received a piece of ecrypted message about Pokemons' ultimate treasure. After we decrypt the message, we realized it includes 2 parts:

1) the data in your current folder, named data.csv

It's a data collected by users in 2016 about appearance information of pokemons in servers all over the world. It records the weather, sunrise/sunset time, pressure, temperature, even latitude and longtitude of pokemons' appearances!

2) a piece of instruction message

It tells us that only the following variables affect pokemons' appearances: latitude, longitude, windSpeed, pressure, sunriseMinutesMidnight, sunsetMinutesMidnight, population_density. If we can find the information about their appearances which distinguishes pokemon1 with pokemon7, and if you put them together in a number string, we'll be able to find the code to the treasure chest!

To better assist you to fulfill these tasks and find the treasure of Pokemons, we also offer the Toolkit.ipynb and the toy.csv dataset to help you understand and better apply the tools!
